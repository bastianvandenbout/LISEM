# LISEM Project

Welcome to the LISEM github page. This project is under development. 

Lisem (Lisem Integrated Spatial Earth Modeller) is a free and open-source software tool that allows users to manipulate geo-spatial data. Featuring both simple operations and advanced algorithms, complex models can be developed. The tool features an internal scripting environment designed for easy data manipulation, a geospatial data viewer, and the LISEM model, which aims at simulation of Hydro-meteorological surface hazards. Additionally, the software comes with Python bindings that allow for interactions with other libraries and automization of code. Have a look at the documetion for more information on how to use and install LISEM.
