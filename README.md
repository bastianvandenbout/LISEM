# LISEM Project

Welcome to the LISEM github page. This project is under development and currently in alpha release.
You are welcome to use the software, but be aware that there are still bugs.

Lisem (Lisem Integrated Spatial Earth Modeller) is a free and open-source software tool that allows users to manipulate geo-spatial data. Featuring both simple operations and advanced algorithms, complex models can be developed. The tool features an internal scripting environment designed for easy data manipulation, a geospatial data viewer, and the LISEM model, which aims at simulation of Hydro-meteorological surface hazards. Additionally, the software comes with Python bindings that allow for interactions with other libraries and automization of code. Have a look at the documetion for more information on how to use and install LISEM.
