Today we have finally uploaded a first link to the compiled new version of LISEM.
This is not just the model, but the full software with all of the tools.
Some of these are slightly (understatement) ambitious. 
Thus, a solid warning is in place:


This software is in alpha release!
There will be bugs, issues and sometimes confusing elements to the interface and algorithms.


We will proceed during the summer and fall to fix the majority of the remaining bugs.
For now, if you wish to use it, check out the docs pages on this website.
If you have comments, found a bug thats particularly nasty, or want to contribute, 
please check the about page for details on how to contact us.


Thanks for your interest!
