Hello users of LISEM! 
Today, I am happy to inform you on the release of version 0.2.4.
The new update features some stability, new functionality, and interface improvements.
I will cover some of these in upcoming youtube videos.

A major bugfix was to the precipitation in the interfaced model.
In 0.2.3, this was not working well, but this should now be fixed.
If you find further bugs, use the github discussions page to inform me and ask help to the other LISEM users.

Thank you for your interest and happy modelling!

Bastian
