Hello users of LISEM! 
After another period of modelling and model usage, there have been more improvements!
There has been quite a number of bug fixes, to the map viewer, efficiency and crash fixes.
Furthermore, there is some new functionality. 
The photogrammetry is now fully working, based on the OpenMVG+OpenMVS pipeline.
The landslide/debris flow model has seen some stability improvements.

You can find the latest version of the software on the downloads page.
Additionally, some new tutorials have been uploaded to the youtube channel.

Thank you for your interest, happy modelling and happy holidays!

Bastian
