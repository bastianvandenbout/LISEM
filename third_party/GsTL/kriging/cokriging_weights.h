/** This function computes cokriging weights.
 * @return 0 if the computation was successful, 1 if solving the kriging
 * system failed, and 2 if no conditioning data were provided (i.e. all 
 * the neighborhoods were empty).
 *
 * @param weights is the vector were the cokriging weights will be stored
 * @param kriging_variance is where the kriging variance will be output
 * @param center is the Location being estimated
 * @param [first_neigh,last_neigh) is a range of Neighborhoods. If it is not
 * desirable that a neighborhood be stored directly into a container (e.g. 
 * because it is a too large object), it suffices to create a "handle" object
 * that meets the requirements of Neighborhood and store the handles into the
 * container.  
 * @param covar is a covariance set
 * @param Kconstraints are the kriging constraints.
