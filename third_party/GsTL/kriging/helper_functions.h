/** A kriging system can be decomposed into two parts: one accounts for 
 * the correlation and redundancy between the variables, while the other
 * part accounts for some linear constraints (e.g. the weights sum-up to 1).
 * The first part is of the form:
 *  [ C11 | C12 ]
 *  [ C21 | C22 ] 
 * (with only 1 secondary variable)
 *
 *This function builds the invariant part C11 of the kriging system. This part 
 * is present in every variant of kriging. It actually only builds the upper
 * half of the matrix (the kriging matrix is symmetric).
 * @param A is a reference to the kriging matrix.
 * @param b is a reference to the second member of the system
 * @param center is the location being estimated
 * @param [first_neigh,last_neigh) is a range of neighbors of "center"
 * @param covar is the covariance function
