 * A parameter in [0,1] is used to set how much modification the servo system is 
 * allowed to do on the input cdf. If it is equal to 0, the input cdf is not 
 * modified at all and the servo system sampler behaves as a classical Monte 
 * Carlo sampler. If the constraint parameter is set to 1, the cdf of all the
