/** Transforms range of values [first, last) by histogram identification.
 * Each element in range [first, last) is replaced by its transformed value.
 * If the initial values are still needed after the transformation, a copy of 
 * [first, last) should be made before being passed to function "cdf_transform".
 * Two versions of the algorithm exist. Version 2 builds the cdf of the data.
 * Both Version 1 and 2 are specialized for the case where the target cdf is 
 * gaussian, so that the min value in [first,last) is not transformed to 
 * minus infinity and the max to plus infinity. 
 *
 * \param [first,last) is the range of values to be transformed. The value in range
 * [first,last) are over-written by their transformed values.
 * \param from is the (original) cdf of the data to be transformed 
 * \param to is the cdf of the transformed values
