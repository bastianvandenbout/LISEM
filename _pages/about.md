The LISEM model is an open-source geospatial modelling tool focused on simulation of physical processes on and in the Earth's surface.

### History
The first publication of the LISEM model was done by De Roo et al. (1994), and the further development was described by De Roo, Offermans & Ritsema (1996) and De Roo, Wesseling & Ritsema (1996). 
These early versions made use of Local Drainage Direction (LDD) functionality to simulate a kinematic wave for overland flow. 
Linked with this flow simulation were erosive and depositional processes, together with expanding descriptings of catchment-scale hydrology.
Later development was continued by Jetten & De Roo (2001). 
Since then, the LISEM model has been extensively tested, used, extended and adapted. 
A variety of applications throughout the world have lead to improvements to the model. Examples can be found in the work of R. Hessel and J. Baartman.
Alongside these published scientific works, numerous research reports of Msc students have contributed to the continuous development.
Starting in 2014, a focus on natural hazard was brought to the model, starting with flash floods.
The move towards two-phase equations was made in 2017, and integrated slope stability was added.
Finally, the development of the integrated spatial modelling tool LISEM, as it is now available here, was initiated in 2020.
